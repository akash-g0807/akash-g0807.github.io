*** Lecture Notes
These will be added to the main notes above in due time but the lecture notes below contain all the information.
+ [[./classical_dynamics/Lecture 13.pdf][Lecture 13]]: Continuation of Analysis of Spinning Tops using Lagrangian Mechanics
+ [[./classical_dynamics/Lecture 14.pdf][Lecture 14]]: Hamiltonian Mechanics and Poission Brackets
+ [[./classical_dynamics/Lecture 15.pdf][Lecture 15]]: Continuation of Poission Brackets and Normal Modes
+ [[./classical_dynamics/Lecture 16.pdf][Lecture 16]]: Phase Portraits and Symmetry

* TODO
- Polish notes and combine Lecture notes to main notes
- Add Dynamical Systems Notes
